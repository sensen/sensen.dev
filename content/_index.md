Hey! I go by Sen.

I'd like to share my experience building a product. My goal is to help other people turning their own idea into a real product!

Since 2 years ago, I've been building a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) product called [Typing Hero](https://typinghero.app). To date, Typing Hero helps **16K+ active users** to expand text **11M+ times** per month. All were done on the side without spending a penny on advertising.

If you'd like to know how I did what works for me, you can follow or reach out to me on the following platforms.

### In the Making

- **[Typing Hero](https://typinghero.app)** Â· A text expander app for Android that helps you to type lesser and write faster with perfect accuracy, while still using your favorite keyboard.
